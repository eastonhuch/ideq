Description: In contrast to other methods of modeling spatio-temporal data,
  dynamic spatio-temporal models (DSTMs) directly model the dynamic
  data-generating process.
  `ideq` supports two main classes of DSTMs:
  (1) empirical orthogonal function (EOF) models and
  (2) integrodifference equation (IDE) models.
  EOF models do not directly use any spatial information;
  instead, they make use of observed relationships in the data
  (the principal components) to model the underlying process.
  In contrast, IDE models are based on diffusion dynamics and the process
  evolution is governed by a (typically Gaussian) redistribution kernel.
  Both types have a variety of options for specifying the model components,
  including the process matrix, process error, and observation error.
